# Ellas_Shoe_EShop
A project of OLTP environment and OLAP environment. Main features: ETL, STAGE, DW, SQL Server, SSIS, etc.

# Description

This is my second project of Business Intelligence. The first one is also here in my GitHub Repository list (Palmeira do Vale).

The project simulates an eletronic shop (Eshop) which sells shoes (female shoes). The inspiration came from a project of my sister, who really wants to create this eshop
in real life someday. 

# Phases

I started creating the data manually and inputting them on Google Forms, as it later saves as sheets. I took the sheets and made an ETL using SSIS (Visual Studio) to make the insert into the database (Ellas_OLTP).

After this phase, the second one was to create the Staging Area and create the scripts of transformation. The scripts were applied on the SSIS environment to practice ETL
since I made the entire process through scrips in my first project (this one I used to also practice more SSIS). 

From the STAGE, the data went to DW with two facts (logistics and shopping). 

The final phase was the creation of the reports in Power BI.

# Skills and softwares used

# Acknowledgment

I will be always grateful to my friend Tulio Brasileiro, who is helping me a lot in this project, as he helped me too in the first one. He is a high skilled Business Intelligence Analyst and Data Scientist. I expect to finally enter this field and keep sharing good moments with my friend, learning much more from him and others new friends that I am sure I will be making in the following years. Thank you!

Surely, the many thanks to the Friend of all friends: dear Lord Jesus Christ, thank You Big Bro.!
